# Go-Reflex-Devel

This is the repo for my docker image [krixlion/go-reflex-dlv](https://hub.docker.com/r/krixlion/go-reflex-dlv) that I use for development of microservices in go.

## Environment variables
BUILD_ARGS - file path \
RUN_ARGS - flags for your compiled binary

## Mount
Container will read everything from `/app` and that's where you should mount your project files.
