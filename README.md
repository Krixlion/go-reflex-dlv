# Go-Reflex-Devel

This is the repo for my [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/krixlion/go-reflex-dlv) that I use for development of microservices in go.

## Environment variables
BUILD_ARGS - file path \
RUN_ARGS - flags for compiled binary
DEBUG_PORT - port on which Delve server will run
DELVE_ARGS - additional flags for Delve to run with

## Mount
Container will read everything from `/app` and that's where you should mount your project root. 

## Examples

### Inside docker-compose.yml 
```docker-compose.yml
services:

  service:
    container_name: debug
    image: krixlion/go-reflex-dlv:1.19.3
